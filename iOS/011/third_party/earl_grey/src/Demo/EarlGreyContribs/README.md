# EarlGrey Contribs

This sample project contains APIs that are still in the experimental phase and need to be
further polished or analyzed before adding as an official EarlGrey API.

`EarlGreyContribs` is a simple project that contains two test targets -
`EarlGreyContribsTests` and `EarlGreyContribsSwiftTests`, both of which are added to our
continuous integration.

If you add an API to either one of the targets, please replicate it in the other as well.

## Getting Started

Run the [setup script](https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/tree/master/Scripts/setup-earlgrey.sh).
You can then open `EarlGreyContribs.xcodeproj` which is already preconfigured to run the tests.
