# Recognize Food With TensorFlow Lite

Android App that uses the CameraX Image Analysis Use-Case and a ML model to classify food in the images captured by the phone back camera.

The <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/aiy/vision/classifier/food_V1/1" >TensorFlow Lite food classification Model</a> by Google used is based on MobileNet V1 and was trained to recognize food dishes from images on a dataset skewed toward North American foods. The training set includes entrees, side dishes, desserts, snacks, etc. For details of the model architecture, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861">MobileNet V1</a>.
