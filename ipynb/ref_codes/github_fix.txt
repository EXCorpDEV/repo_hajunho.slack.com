Step 1: Navigate to a valid directory
The "No such file or directory" error suggests your current directory might have been affected by the stash. First, navigate to your repository root:
bashcd ~/path/to/repo_hajunho.slack.com
Or if you're unsure of the path:
bashpwd
ls -la
Step 2: Check your repository status
Once you're in a valid directory within your repo:
bashgit status
git log --oneline -5
Step 3: Pull the remote changes
Now that your working directory is clean (thanks to the stash), you can pull:
bashgit pull origin master
Step 4: Restore your stashed changes
After successfully pulling, restore your local changes:
bashgit stash pop
Step 5: Resolve any merge conflicts
If there are conflicts between your stashed changes and the pulled changes, Git will mark them. Edit the conflicted files to resolve them, then:
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
Step 6: Push your changes
Finally, push your integrated changes:
bashgit push origin master
