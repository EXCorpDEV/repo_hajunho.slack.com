üéØ Project Overview
This project aims to create comprehensive, age-categorized English dictionaries using AI language models. Our goal is to contribute to educational diversity by generating alternative English dictionary resources that complement existing traditional dictionaries.
The project leverages local AI models through Ollama to collect, categorize, and enhance English vocabulary with Korean translations, age-appropriate classifications, and usage examples - creating valuable resources for language learners and educators.
üåü Key Features

Massive Scale Collection: Capable of generating dictionaries with 15,000+ words
Age-Based Classification: Words categorized by learning levels (Elementary, Middle School, High School, Adult, Professional)
Multilingual Support: English words with Korean translations and examples
Automated Processing: Two-stage pipeline for efficient large-scale dictionary generation
Prefix-Based Collection: Advanced collection strategy using alphabetical prefixes (aa, ab, ac...) for comprehensive coverage
Structured Output: JSON format for easy integration and further processing

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
Two-Stage Pipeline
Stage 1: Basic Word Collection

Collects raw English words using prefix-based approach
Supports multiple collection modes (adaptive, 2-letter, 3-letter)
Handles up to 676 prefixes (aa-zz) for maximum coverage
Automatic deduplication and validation

Stage 2: Enhanced Information

Adds Korean translations, age classifications, and usage examples
Processes words in chunks for efficiency
Generates comprehensive statistics and metadata

üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Pull your preferred model (example)
ollama pull gpt-oss:120b
Installation
git clone https://github.com/EXCorpDEV/repo_hajunho.slack.com.git 
cd ai-english-dictionary
pip install requests
Basic Usage
# Stage 1: Collect basic words (adaptive mode - recommended for beginners)
python3 massive_dict.py --stage 1 --mode adaptive --batch 30

# Stage 2: Enhance with detailed information
python3 massive_dict.py --stage 2 --file [generated_file]
Advanced Usage
# Large-scale dictionary generation (15,000+ words)
python3 massive_dict.py --stage 1 --mode 2letter --batch 35

# Custom model and settings
python3 massive_dict.py --stage 1 --model your-model:latest --batch 50

# Automated full pipeline
